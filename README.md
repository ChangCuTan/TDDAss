## Design Patterns
There are several design patterns that could be useful for implementing in this assesment,
Some potential options include the following:

    1)The Strategy pattern, which allows different algorithms or 
    calculation strategies to be used interchangeably with the calculator

    2)The Mediator pattern is used to reduce complexity between multiple objects or classes.
    handles all the complexity between different classes and supports easy maintenance of the code.

    3)The Singleton pattern, which can be used to ensure that only one instance of the calculator is 
    created and used throughout the application

The Best Design paterns for this assesment is Mediator pattern, beacause it can handel the complexity input string from user 
and use a best strategy throught algorithm to provide the answer.
